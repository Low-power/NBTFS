This source tree contains utilities for maintaining NBT files and Minecraft
Region files. The primary part is a FUSE-based file system implementation
which allowing NBT file or Minecraft Region file be mounted as a file system,
and then modified using normal file operations.

NBT parser and writer are originally written by Lukas Niederbremer as cNBT
project which this project is based on.

INSTALL
=======
To build it from source, make sure you have GCC or a compatible C compiler,
GNU Make or BSD make, FUSE development library, as well as zlib development
library installed, then type 'make'; some environment variables are useful to
configure the build:
	CC		C compiler
	AR		archive tool for creating static library
	CFLAGS		prepend flags to C compiler
	LDFLAGS		prepend flags to linker (e.g. -L <path>)
Example:
	$ CC=gcc CFLAGS=-Os make

To install built programs and manual pages, type 'make install'; some
attitional environment variables may be used here:
	PREFIX		installing prefix, default /usr/local
	BINDIR		default ${PREFIX}/bin
	SBINDIR		default ${PREFIX}/sbin
	DATADIR		default ${PREFIX}/share
	MANDIR		default ${DATADIR}/man

MONUT THE FILE SYSTEM
=====================
Use program mount.nbt(8) to mount the file system from a NBT file or a Region
file. The synopsis of the command line is:
	mount.nbt [-o <fs-options>] [<other-options>] <mount-from-file> <mount-point>
The <fs-options> accepts both generic and FS-specific mount options; some
of them are useful to specify here; see man page mount.nbt(8) for a detailed
description of each FS-specific option.

Example:
	# mount.nbt -o ro,region,umask=0022 /usr/home/minecraft/aether-realm/world/AETHER/region/r.1.1.mca /mnt/region/
	# ls -al /mnt/region/80/Level/
	total 0
