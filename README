This source tree contains utilities for maintaining NBT files and Minecraft
Region files. The primary part is a FUSE-based file system implementation
which allowing NBT file or Minecraft Region file be mounted as a file system,
and then modified using normal file operations.

INSTALL
=======
To build it from source, make sure you have GCC or a compatible C compiler,
GNU Make or BSD make, FUSE development library, as well as zlib development
library installed, then type 'make'; some environment variables are useful to
configure the build:
	CC		C compiler
	AR		archive tool for creating static library
	CFLAGS		prepend flags to C compiler
	LDFLAGS		prepend flags to linker (e.g. -L <path>)
Example:
	$ CC=gcc CFLAGS=-Os make

MONUT THE FILE SYSTEM
=====================
Use program mount.nbt(8) to mount the file system from a NBT file or a Region
file. The synopsis of the command line is:
	mount.nbt [-o <fs-options>] [<other-options>] <mount-from-file> <mount-point>
The <fs-options> accepts both FUSE-specific and NBTFS-specific mount options,
some useful ones are:
	ro		Mount the file system read-only, useful to mount from
			a file that can't be written to, or to prevent
			accidentally changing it; but see 'writefile' option
			later
	rw		Revert any early 'ro' option
	region		Specify the mount from file is a Minecraft Region
			file instead of a standalone NBT file
	typeprefix	Use node type prefix for node names when listing
			compound nodes as a directory
	umask=<mask>	Set file mode mask using an octal number for NBT
			nodes, default 0
	writefile=<path>	Set an alternative path for writing NBT data;
				the original mount from file won't be written
				to if this is specified; has no effect when
				file system is mounted read-only
	compression={gzip|zlib}	Set compression format for writing NBT data;
				default 'gzip' for NBT file, 'zlib' for
				Region file; has no effect when file system
				is mounted read-only
Note the writing happens only when the file system is unmounted; if anything
went wrong during this process, the error message will be sent to syslog(3),
and unfortunately the data is most likely be lost as a result.
Example:
	# mount.nbt -o ro,region,umask=0022 /usr/home/minecraft/aether-realm/world/AETHER/region/r.1.1.mca /mnt/region/
	# ls -al /mnt/region/80/Level/
